**$ Chapter 1 Computer Abstractions and Technology $**


**1.1 Introduction**

3 different classes of copmuting applications:
- Personal computers (PCs) ---> Personal mobile device (PMD)
- Servers                  ---> Cloud computing
- Embedded computers


**1.2 Eight Great Ideas in Computer Architecture**

1) Design for Moore's Law (Graph)
  Moore's Law : integrated circuit resources double every 18-24 months
  Computer architects must anticipate where the technology will be when the design finshes, not when it starts
  
2) Use Abstraction to Simply Design (Picasso)
  Use abstractions to represent the design effectively
  
3) Make the Common Case Fast (Car)
  Enhance performance better than optimizing the rare case, and is also simpler

4) Performance via Parallism (Airplane)
  Designs that get more performance by performing operations in parallel
  
5) Performance via Pipelining (Pipe)
  Pipelining : a particular pattern of parallelism

6) Performance via Prediction (Crystall Ball)
  Sometimes it is faster if recoverable and relatively accurate
  
7) Hierarchy of Memories (Pyramid)

8) Dependability via Redundancy (Truck)
  Make systems dependable by including redundant components that can take over when a failure occurs and to help detect failures


**1.3 Below Your Program**

Hierarchy of software : (Lowest) Hardware -> Systems Software -> Applications Software

Two important types of systems software : Operating System & Compiler
- OS : interfaces between a user's program and hardware.
       Provide many services and supervisory functions
       Important funcionts:
        - Handling basic input and output operations
        - Allocating storage and memory
        - Providing for protected sharing of the computer among multiple applications using it simultaneously
- Compilers : translate a program written in high-level languages into instructions that hardware can execute



-------------------------------------------

* Vocab
  
- Personal computers (PCs)
  : a computer for an individual, usually with a graphic display, a keyboard, and a mouse

- Server
  : a computer for larger programs and accessed only via a network
 
- Embedded computers
  : a computer inside another device and used for running a single or a collection of software
  
- Personal mobile device (PMD)
  : small, wireless devices to connect to the Internet (ex: smart phones, tablets)
  
- Cloud Computing
  : larger collections of servers that provide services over the Internet. Relies on giant datacenters known as Warehouse Scale Copmuters (WSCs)
  
- Software as a service (SaaS)
  : delivers software and data as a service over the Internet (ex: web search, social networking)
  
- Systems Software
  : Software that provides services that are commonly useful like operating systems, compilers, loaders, assemblers...

- Operating System
  : Supervising program that manages the resources of a computer for the benefit of the programs that run on that computer
  
- Compiler
  : A program that translates high-level language statements into assembly language statements
