**Chapter 1 (Part I)**\
RISC-V: first such architecture designed to be used in modern computing environments, such as cloud computing, mobile devices, and other embedded systems\
Supercomputers: high-end scientific and engineering calculations, highest capability\
Embedded computers: hidden as components of systems, stringent power/performance/cost constraints\
Personal Mobile Device (PMD): battery, internet, smart phones/tablets/electronic glasses...\
Cloud Computing: Warehouse Scale Computers (WSC), Software as a Service (SaaS), Portion of software run on a PMD and in the cloud, Amazon/Google...\
\
Understanding Performance:\
&nbsp;- Alogrithm: determines the number of operations executed\
&nbsp;- Programming language, compiler, architecture: determines the number of machine instructions executed per opertion\
&nbsp;- Processor and memory system: determines how fast instructions are executed\
&nbsp;- I/O system (including OS): determines how fast I/O operations are executed\
\
Eight Great Ideas: Moore's Law / Abstraction / common case fast / parallelism / pipelining / prediction / hierarchy /dependability\
Application software: written in high-level language\
System software:\
&nbsp; Compiler: translates HLL code to machine code\
&nbsp; OS: service code: handling I/O, manage memory/storage, schedule tasks/share resources\
Hardware: processor, memory, I/O controllers\
\
High-level language: level of abstraction closer to problem domain, provides productivity and portability\
Assembly language: textual representation of instructions\
Hardware representation: binary digits (bits), encoded instructions and data\
\
Components of a computer:\
&nbsp;- Same components for all kinds of computer: desktop, server, embedded\
&nbsp;- Input/output includes: user-interface devices (display/keyboard/mouse), Storage devices (Hard disk/CD/DVD/flash), Network adaptors (communicate with other computers)\
\
Inside the Processor (CPU):\
&nbsp;- Datapath: performs operations on data\
&nbsp;- Control: sequences datapath, memory, ...\
&nbsp;- Cache memory: small fast SRAM memory for immediate access to data\
\
Abstractions:\
&nbsp;- Abstraction helps us deal with complexity: hide lower-level detail\
&nbsp;- Instruction set architecture (ISA): the hardware/software interface\
&nbsp;- Application binary interface: the ISA plus system softwaare interface\
&nbsp;- Implementation: the details underlying and interface\
\
Semiconductor Technology:\
&nbsp;- silicon atoms (semiconductor)\
&nbsp;- add materials to transform properties: np conductors, switch\
\
Manufacturing ICs:\
&nbsp;- Slice -> wafers -> process -> patterned wafers -> wafer tester ->  dicer -> bond die to package -> part tester -> ship
&nbsp;- Yield: proportion of working dies per wafer\
