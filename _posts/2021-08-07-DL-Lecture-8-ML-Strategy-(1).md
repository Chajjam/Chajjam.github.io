**8.1 Why ML Strategy**\
Ideas:\
&nbsp;- Collect more data\
&nbsp;- Collect more diverse training set\
&nbsp;- Train algorithm longer with gradient descent\
&nbsp;- Try Adam instead of gradient descent\
&nbsp;- Try bigger network\
&nbsp;- Try smaller network\
&nbsp;- Try dropout\
&nbsp;- Add L<sub>2</sub> regularization\
&nbsp;- Network architecture\
\
\
**8.2 Orthogonalization**\
Orthogonalization: each "knob" does one thing\
\
\
**8.3 Single Number Evaluation Metric**
Using single number evaluation metric helps us to make decision faster\
\
\
**8.4 Satisficing and Optimizing Metric**\
