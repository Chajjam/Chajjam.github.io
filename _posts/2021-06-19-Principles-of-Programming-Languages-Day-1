**Chpater 1 Inductive Sets of Data**

**1.1 Recursively Specified Data**

**1.1.1 Inductive Specification**

Inductive Specification: method of specifying a set of values
- consider a certain subset S of the natural numbers N = { 0, 1, 2, ... }
**Definition 1.1.1**
A natural number n is in S if and only if
1. n = 0, or
2. n-3 ∈ S.
=> conc. S is the set of natural numbers that are multiples of 3

use this definition to write a procedure to decide whether a natural number n is in S.

```C
in-S? : N -> Bool
usage:  (in-S? n) = #t if n is in S, #f otherwise
(define in-S?
  (lambda (n)
    (if (zero? n) #t
      (if (>= (- n 3) 0)
        (in-S? (- n 3) )
        #f))))
```

```C
in-S? : N -> Bool
```
Contract: a comment for the procedure
Here, it means that *in-S?* is intended to be a procedure that takes a natural number and produces a boolean

To determine whether n∈S, we first ask whether n = 0.
If it is, then the answer is true.

Otherwise, we need to see whether n - 3 ∈ S.
To do this, we first check to see whether (n - 3) ≥ 0.
If it is, we then can use our procedure to see whether it is in S.
If it is not, then n cannot be in S.

**Definition 1.1.2**
Define the set S to be the smallest set contained in N and satisfying the following two properties:
1. 0∈S, and
2. if n∈S, then n+3∈S.

smallest set: one that satisfies the properties and is a subset of any other set satisfying the properties
To show there can be only one such set:
if S_1 and S_2 both satisfy properties 1 and 2, and both are amllest, then
S_1⊆S_2 (Since S_1 is smallest), and
S_2⊆S_2 (Since S_2 is smallest), hence
S_1 = S_2.

The definition can be alternatively written as:
____
0∈S

n∈S
________
(n+3)∈S

each entry: a rule of inference (or a rule)
____: "if-then"
part above the line: hypothesis or antecedent
part below the line: conclusion or consequent
when there are two or more hypotheses listed, they are connected by an implicit "and".
A rule with no hypoteses is called an *axiom*

The rules are interpreted as:
- a natural number n is in S if and only if the statement "n∈S" can be derived from the axioms
  by using the rules of inference finitely many times.

3 versions of the definition : top-down, bottom-up, rules-of-inference

**Definition 1.1.3** (top-down)
A Scheme list is a list of integers if and only if either
1. it is the empty list, or
2. it is a pair whose car is an integer and whose cdr is a list of integers.

**Definition 1.1.4** (bottom-up)
* Int: the set of all integers
* List-of-Int: the set of lists of integers
* infix . denotes the result of the cons operation in Scheme
  (n . l) denotes a Scheme pair whose car is n and whose cdr is l.
The set List-of-Int is the smallest set of Scheme lists satisfying the following two properties:
1. ()∈List-of-Int, and
2. if n∈Int and l∈List-of-Int, then (n . l) ∈ List-of-Int.
