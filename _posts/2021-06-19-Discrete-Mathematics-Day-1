**Chpater 1 The Foundations: Logic and Proofs*

**1.1 Propositional Logic**
Proposition : a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both

*Example 1*
All the following declarative sentences are propositions
    1. Washington, D.C., is the captial of the United States of America
      => true
    2. Toronto is the capital of Canada
      => false
    3. 1 + 1 = 2
      => true
    4. 2 + 2 = 3
      => false
      
*Example 2*
Consider the following sentences
    1. What time is it?       => not a proposition because not declarative
    2. Read this carefully.   => not a proposition because not declarative
    3. x + 1 = 2              => not a proposition because neither true nor false
    4. x + y = z              => not a proposition because neither true nor false

Conventional letters for propositional variables : p, q, r, s...
Letter for truth value : T and F

New propositions, called compound propositions, are formed by from existing propositions using logical operators

**DEFINITION 1**
Let p be a proposition.
The negation of p, denoted by ¬p (or p bar) (I will write this in ~p from now) is  "it is not the case that p"
The proposition ~p is read "not p".
The truth value of the negation of p, ~p, is the opposite of the truth value of p.

*Example 3*
Find the negation of the proposition
  "Michael's PC runs Linux"
and express this in simple English

My Answer:
  "Michael's PC does not run Linux"
  
Solution:
  Negation: "It is not the case that Michael's PC runs Linux"
  Simple En : "Michael's PC does not run Linux"
  
*Example 4*
Find the negation of the proposition
  "Vandana's smartphone has at leaset 32GB of memory"
and in simple English

My Answer:
  Negation: "It is not the case that Vandana's smartphone has at least 32GB of memory"
  Simple En : "Vandana's smartphone has memory less than 32GB."

**DEFINITION 2**
Let p and q be propositions. The conjunction of p and q, denoted by p∧q, is the proposition
"p and q". The conjunction p∧q is true when both p and q are true and is false otherwise.
  * "but" is sometimes used instead of "and" (ex: "Thu sun is shining, but(=and) it is raining")

*Example 5*
Find the conjunction of propositions p and q where 
p: "Rebecca's PC has more than 16GB free hard disk space."
q: "The processor in Rebecca's PC runs faster than 1 GHz."

My Answer:
"Rebecca's PC has more than 16GB free hard disk space and the processor in Rebecca's PC runs faster than 1GHz."

Solution:
"Rebecca's PC has more than 16GB free hard disk space, and its processor runs faster than 1GHz."

**DEFINITION 3**
Let p and q be propositions.
The disjunction of p and q, denoted by p∨q, is the proposition "p or q".
The disjunction p∨q is false when both p and q are false and is true otherwise
*includes both inclusive(both true) and exclusive(if one is true and another is false) or

*Example 6*
What is the disjunction of the propositions p and q where p and q are the same propositions as in Example 5?
p: "Rebecca's PC has more than 16GB free hard disk space."
q: "The processor in Rebecca's PC runs faster than 1 GHz."

My Answer:
"Rebecca's PC has more than 16GB free hard disk space or its processor runs faster than 1 GHz."

Solution:
"Rebecca's PC has at least 16GB free hard disk space, or the processor in Rebecca's PC runs faster than 1GHz."

**DEFINITION 4**
Let p and q be propositions. The exclusive or of p and q, denoted by p⊕q, is the proposition
that is true when exactly one of p and q is true and false otherwise.

**DEFINITION 5**
Let p and q be propositions.
The conditional statement p -> q is the proposition "if p, then q."
The conditional statement p -> q is false when p is true and q is false, and true otherwise.
In the conditional statement p -> q, p is called the hypothesis (or antecedent/premise)
                                     q is called the conclusion (or consequence)
* Conditional statement is also called an implication

terminologies used to express conditional statements:
- if p, then q
- p implies q
- if p, q
- p only if q
- p is sufficient for q
- a sufficient condition for q is p
- q if p
- q whenever p
- q when p
- q is necessary for p
- a necessary condition for p is q
- q follows from p
- q unless ~p

*Example 7*
Let p be the statement "Maria learns discrete mathematics"
and q the statement "Maria will find a good job."
Express the statemnet p -> q as a statement in English

My Answer:
"If Maria learns discrete Mathematics, she will find a good job."

* Caution: Conditional statements in daily lives differ from conditional statement in logics
ex:
"If Juan has a smartphone, then 2 + 3 = 5"
  => true, because q is true
"If Juan has a smartphone, then 2 + 3 = 6"
  => true if Juan does not have a smartphone because p is false
  
*Example 8*
What is the value of the variable x after the statement
  if 2 + 2 = 4 then x := x + 1
if x = 0 before this statement is encountered? (:= stands for assignment)

My Answer:
1
